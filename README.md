# Arduino audio visualizer

  ## Libraries used:
 - [ArduinoFFT](https://github.com/kosme/arduinoFFT)
 - [U8G2lib](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2)
 
## TODO
- [x] Basic code
 - [ ] Creating schematics
 - [ ] Adding AMP between audio source and arduino
 - [ ] Better audio sensitivity (maybe automatic sensitivity range)
 - [ ] Maybe switching between inputs **AUX/MIC**
 - [ ] Better modularity
